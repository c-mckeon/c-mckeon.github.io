            <strong>MSc. Health-Biology - Translational Medicinal Chemistry                    <span class="dates">2020 – 2022</span><br>
            University of Montpellier                                  <span class="dates">Mention Très Bien (1st Class Honours)</span></strong><br>
            <br>
            • This two-year degree, taught through French, was aimed at developing the interdisciplinary skills required to meet current needs in the translation of research into actionable therapies and medicines. <br>
            <br>
            • During these two years I became very interested in genomics and structural and molecular biology. I oriented my modules and internships to pursue a career developing cell and gene therapies, choosing courses in: <u>Functional Genomics, Cell Culture, Structural Biology, Molecular and Metabolic bases of genetic disease, Mechanistic Bases of Genetic and Epigenetic Information, <u>and</u> Cellular Communication and Signalling.</u><br>
            <br>
            • This programme also involved exploring innovative approaches to drug development with modules such as: <u>Rational Innovation from Target to Medicine and Nanotechnologies for Therapeutic Vectorisation and Targeting,</u> and gaining interdisciplinary skills with modules such as <u>Bioinformatics and Systems Biology,</u> and <u>Biostatistics in R.</u><br>

            University of Galway         <span class="dates"> 1st Class Honours</span></strong><br>
            <br>
            • This four-year programme allowed me to take a variety of subjects in the general scientific field before deciding to specialise in Chemistry for my honours degree.<br>
            <br>
            • The first two years of this four year degree focused on gaining a strong understanding of fundamental concepts in <u> Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Biochemistry</u> and <u>Chemistry.</u><br>
            <br>
            • The final two years involved in-depth study of advanced concepts in <u>Biochemistry, Organic, Inorganic, Analytical, Physical</u> and <u>Biophysical Chemistry </u>, alongside a research internship and a written and orally defended thesis, in which I evaluated the viability of exploring the wealth of specialized bioactive metabolites present in deep-sea organisms as a source for new drug lead compounds.<br>

            Montpellier Research Centre for Cell Biology </strong><br>
            • Trainee researcher exploring the roles of co-activator complexes in gene expression regulation.<br>
            <br>
            • My work involved firstly editing and transforming plasmids in yeast, to create a Cre-Lox inducible mutation system at the endogenous gene of Epl1 – a subunit of the NuA4 coactivator complex. I verified successful gene editing by genomic PCR and Western Blot of affinity-purified protein. I performed RT-qPCR on purified total RNA to analyse the effect of inducing the mutation on the expression of a regulated gene.<br>
            <br>
            • My collaboration on this project earned me a place as a co-author on a forthcoming publication in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology.<br>

            <br>
            • I produced membrane-bound GPCRs in SF9 cells, which I purified and used alongside purified bacterial leukotoxins in Native and HDX-MS analyses to identify binding stoichiometries, protein interaction interfaces, and allosteric binding effects.<br>
